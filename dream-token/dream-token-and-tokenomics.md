**Total Supply: 1,000,000,000**

**TGE: Q4 2023**

**As the team believes deeply in the values of web3, decentralization, and open-source software, the launch of the $DREAM token has been designed with all of this in mind, and will be conducted using a "Fair Launch Auction", as opposed to other TGE events.**&#x20;
