**Total Supply: 1,000,000,000**

**TGE: October 30th, 2023 - Fjord Foundry**

As the team believes deeply in the values of web3, decentralization, and open-source software, the launch of the $DREAM token has been designed with all of this in mind, and will be conducted using a "Fair Launch Auction", as opposed to other TGE events.&#x20;

### **Allocation**

1 billion DREAM have been minted at genesis and will become accessible in time. If you are familiar with UNI (Uniswap Token), you will notice that DREAM follows a similar schedule, with  cliffs and vesting for advisors. The initial allocation is as follows:&#x20;

* 51% to DREAMBYT3 community members _`510,000,000 DREAM`_&#x20;
* 28% to past and future core contributors with 1-month cliff 1-year vesting _`280,000,000 DREAM`_&#x20;
* 8% to investors with 3-month cliff and 1-year vesting _`80,000,000 DREAM`_&#x20;
* 3% to advisors with 3-month cliff and 1-year vesting _`30,000,000 DREAM`_&#x20;
* 10% to the DREAM LBP event _`100,000,000 DREAM`_&#x20;

Total DREAM Supply: _`1,000,000,000 DREAM`_&#x20;

Core contributors' and launch partners' DREAM allocations will have tokens vested on an identical schedule with the addition of a 1 month cliff for transfers. Advisors' DREAM allocation will vest over 12 months with a 3 month cliff.
