# ðŸ’§ $DREAM Airdrop Seasons

### $DREAM Airdrops:

We all witnessed what took place when Blur introduced a token tied to specific user incentives onchain. By employing data-driven analytics, we can see what worked well, what didn't work quite so well, and continually refine user acquisition to the DREAMBYT3 marketplace. And with the teams foundational focus on sustainability, an hence the veToken model being implemented, the ability to **retain** those users grows exponentially.

{% hint style="info" %}
We asked: what if we could break down Blur's algorithm, and use Machine Learning to dramatically improve the effectiveness of the incentives being offered?&#x20;
{% endhint %}

What we ended up with is the DREAMBYT3 Airdrop Seasons Formula, of which there will be 3 Seasons, which in total will end up comprising a majority of the entire $DREAM token supply allocation.\
\
As a concrete example, have a look at how we've optimized Season 1 for building marketplace NFT liquidity while also encouraging a healthy supply of the $DREAM token liquidity onchain.

Blur used 4 primary factors as their primary drivers of accumulating Points, in addition to those 4, we identified 3 specific areas to that make logical sense for improving upon the Blur formula. These additions will allow users to earn additional XP Points in an even more user/marketplace alignment of incentives, which is our goal. Like Blur, we will operate a 24 hour rolling leaderboard, with a new round set to begin every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC.\
\
**DREAMBYT3 Algorithm Innovations:**

1. Trading Frequency, rewarding users based on the frequency of their trades.
2. Loyalty Decay, introduces a decay factor for loyalty.
3. veDREAM Boost, rewarding users based on the amount of veDREAM tokens they have staked in proportion to the total veDREAM tokens in existence.

// The DREAMBYT3 Airdrop Algorithm Design Adds 3 New Factor When Calculating XP Points

Risk_j: Encourages users to place riskier bids.
Time_j: Rewards users for the time their bids are active.
CollectionActivity_j: Emphasizes collections with higher trading activity.
ItemIncentive_j: Incentivizes specific items within collections.
TradingFrequency_j: Rewards users based on the frequency of their trades.
Loyalty_j: Introduces a decay factor for loyalty.
Boost_j: Rewards users based on the amount of veDREAM tokens they have staked in proportion to the total veDREAM tokens in existence.

Blur Algorithm = XP_j = k1 * Risk_j + k2 * Time_j + k3 * CollectionActivity_j + k4 * ItemIncentive_j 

DREAMBYT3 Algorithm = XP_j = k1 * Risk_j + k2 * Time_j + k3 * CollectionActivity_j + k4 * ItemIncentive_j + k5 * TradingFrequency_j + k6 * Loyalty_j + k7 * Boost_j
```

### Season 1

Season 1 will be largely about creating momentum for DREAMBYT3 and showing NFT users that not only is their a sustainable NFT marketplace that has been built, but also that they can be rewarded in a potentially significant way by participating.&#x20;

### Season 2

Will begin after Season 1, and will incentivize different behaviors as the DREAMBYT3 marketplace matures and establishes strong moat in the NFT marketplace arena.&#x20;

### Season 3

Season 3 will be the longest last, and largest allocation of $DREAM tokens, refined and designed to be delivered to the most loyal and transparently fair airdrop in web3 history.
