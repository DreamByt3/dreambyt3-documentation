# ‚≠ê Why DREAMBYT3?

### TLDR:

Do you like passive income? Consider staking your $DREAM LP tokens to get your share of marketplace trading fees, on a weekly basis, claimable in $WETH.

### Revenue Sharing

50% of all marketplace fees will be distributed to $DREAM LP stakers in $WETH, every single week pro-rata to their share of veDREAM. In our quest towards building a sustainable NFT marketplace, we realized the innovation needed is rather simple: share fees with community members who are aligned with the long-term goals of the DREAM DAO. Hence, we will be sharing revenue with our users who stake $DREAM LP tokens from the very beginning.

### Low Fees

A flat 1% fee is all it costs to trade NFTs on the DREAMBYT3 marketplace.
